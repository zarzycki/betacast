# Cyclone tracking in Betacast

---

### Overview

Two main steps:

1. Acquire TCVitals from NHC or other source.
2. Low-bar pass of TC tracks using TempestExtremes.
3. (Optional) Perform statistics with MET-TC.

### Acquire TC Vitals file

First, we need to figure out exactly where the operational centers deemed observed TCs to be at the same time as the Betacast initialization. These can be gleaned from a couple different sources, with the below bash script attempting to figure out the correct source.

```
/bin/bash ./get-vitals.sh ${YYYYMMDDHH} ${TCVITFOLDER}
```

where: `${YYYYMMDDHH}` is the forecast cycle and `${TCVITFOLDER}` is the folder where the vitals file will be saved.

Example:

```
/bin/bash ./get-vitals.sh 2018082100 ./fin-tcvitals/
```

Will procure the TC Vitals file for Aug, 21. 2018 at 00Z and store it within a sub-folder named `fin-tcvitals`. Each init time will get a single file where there will be N rows consisting of the N observed cyclones globally at that time.

### Track all cyclones and match to TCVitals

Requirements: CAM or EAM data with PSL, UBOT, and VBOT on the files at <= 6-hourly time frequency. Code only tracks at 6-hourly frequency (to match WMO operations) so if higher time frequency is passed in (e.g., 3-hourly) the `TIMESTRIDE` argument below must be updated.

Then `./drive-tracking.sh` can be invoked with the following format (11 command line arguments!).

```
/bin/bash ./drive-tracking.sh ${YYYYMMDDHH} \
	${CASENAME} \
	${TCVITFILE} \
	${ATCFFILE} \
	${TE_CONNECTFILE} \
	${OUTPUTBASE} \
	${SENDHTML} \
	${HSTREAM} \
	${TIMESTRIDE} \
	${ATCFTECH} \
	${TE_NOMPI_DIR}
```

| Namelist Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| YYYYMMDDHH | Forecast cycle as 10-digit integer |
| CASENAME | Name of the Betacast case (ex: conus_30_x8_forecast) |
| TCVITFILE | Full path to TC Vitals file for matching |
| ATCFFILE | Full path to desired output ATCF file |
| TE_CONNECTFILE | Connectivity file required by TE |
| OUTPUTBASE | Path to Betacast case base (i.e., fullpath before date folder) |
| SENDHTML | Send files to Colin's server? Generally false. |
| HSTREAM | Which "h" stream for EAM/CAM contains the tracker variables required by TE? |
| TIMESTRIDE | Do I stride TE files? Should be 6 for hourly, 2 for 3-hourly, 1 for 6-hourly |
| ATCFTECH | Shortcode to use in ATCF files (ex: op centers using GFSO, HWRF, etc.) |
| TE_NOMPI_DIR | Top-level path to a serial version of TempestExtremes |

After this script is successful, an [ATCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Tropical_Cyclone_Forecasting_System) file for this particular forecast cycle will be generated in `./fin-atcf`. If there is no ATCF for this particular cycle, a new one will be generated. If one already exists, any lines in the ATCF that match `ATCFTECH` will be purged, with new lines appended. This allows for serial appending of various ensemble members (e.g., CAM001, CAM002, CAM003, etc.).

### Calculate statistics with ATCF data

An optional (but common) step is to calculate a variety of operational statistics with DTC's [Model Evaluation Tools](https://dtcenter.org/community-code/model-evaluation-tools-met). This is beyond the scope of this README right now, but the ATCF that comes out of this code can be used as any a-deck file would be for any model. See the above link for more details.
