### Some notes:

#### Downscaling CAM data

For downscaling CAM data one must pass in:

- mod_in_topo
- mod_remap_file

`mod_remap_file` should be an ESMF file going from the CAM input data to the analysis grid of interest (unless the forcing data is high-res, using the ERA5 0.25deg grid seems to be safest -- e.g., ne120 -> 0.25x0.25). `mod_in_topo` should be the path to the bnd_topo file containing PHIS for the downscaling model grid (e.g., ne120).

`data_filename` must contain a snapshot of 3-D U, V, T, Q, and 2-D PS. The requested `YYYYMMDDHH` must lie within the bounds of the time dimension in `data_filename`.

#### MPAS data

For MPAS data, the input variable `model_topo_file` actually contains the full initial condition file generated by MPAS's `init_atmosphere` routine. If one sets `mpas_as_cam` to False, `model_topo_file` will be copied to `se_inic` and then the state fields overwritten by the script so that the `se_inic` file can be passed in as an `ncdata` file.

#### Hydrostatic adjustment

Currently the hydrostatic adjustment is only available when `dycore` is set to SE. The code is activated if a valid `model_topo_file` containing `PHIS` is passed in and `adjust_config` is not an empty string. If `adjust_config=a` that applies a special case where both PS and TBOT are adjusted. Otherwise, only PS is adjusted. All state fields are then reinterpolated based on the new hybrid pressure levels associated with the updated PS.

#### Using RDA data

On Cheyenne (and when mirrored on other systems) Betacast can go directly to RDA to get ERA5 data. To do this, point `RDADIR` to the datasets top-level directory (e.g., /glade/collections/rda/data/ds633.0/). In this case, this file will be used if the hydrostatic adjustment code is active where `data_filename` is the invariant field containing the surface Z field (e.g., ${RDADIR}/e5.oper.invariant/197901/e5.oper.invariant.128_129_z.ll025sc.1979010100_1979010100.nc).
